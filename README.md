# Babel 6.x presets for Node 6.x

Node 6.x comes with V8 v5.x which brings [~93% native ES6/ES2015 coverage](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#chrome50). This preset for Babel 6 attempts
to bridge the gap for the much of the remaining ~7% using [Babel plug-ins](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages).

Based on Node.js [v6.0.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.0.0/)

## Why

Babel 6.x is awesome, but simply including the [ES2015 preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015) means you're transpiling features
that your Node 6.x installation can already do faster and natively, replacing them with inferior / older code.

This preset complements existing V8-native functionality - it doesn't work _around_ it.

The end result is nearly always a faster build and script execution time.

## Included Plugins:

* babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs
* babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator
* babel-plugin-transform-class-properties
* babel-plugin-transform-es2015-parameters
* babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread

## Installation

Install via NPM the usual way:

`npm i babel-preset-nodejs6`

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (recommended)

Create a `.babelrc` file in your project root, and include 'node5' in your preset path:

```js
{
  "presets": [
    "nodejs6"
  ]
}
```

Now whenever you run `babel-node`, it will polyfill your app with the remaining ES2015 features that Node 6 is missing.

### Via CLI
`$ babel script.js --presets nodejs6`

## How to add React support

Babel has a ready-made preset for React, and you now need to install it separately.

Just grab it via NPM:

`npm i babel-preset-react`

And then add it to your "presets" list in `.babelrc`:

```js
{
  "presets": [
    "nodejs6",
    "react"
  ]
}
```
